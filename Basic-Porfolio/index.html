          <p>Welcome to my portfolio, I really apprecciate you visiting! first a little bit about me. I am 29 years old, and grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area.
            I've been into everything technology ever since my dad brought home the most massive laptop ever before I could even remember how old I was. I used to spend hours
            on-line with dialup internet and literally ruin the phone forever for my family. I've visited just four other states but I've lived down in San Luis Obispo for about five years.
            During that time my roommate was going to Cal Poly for Electrical Engineering and we did all kinds of fun things. What really inspired me to finally persue web development was
            talking with him! He's a backend developer specializing in C# and that made it click, "if he went to school for Electical Engineering then made his hobby of programming his job why cant I?"
            I've always dabbled in front end development but decided that I need to dive full in and really persure my creative passion fullstack style. Until I decided to enroll in Bootcamp I have been entirely self taught.
            I hope that this has given you a little insight into me, if you have any questions please <a href="contact" target="_blank">contact me!</a> I'd really love to hear from you.
            Check out my portfolio if you're interested in seeing what I can do. Thanks again for taking the time to read through this I wish you a great day!

            Keep it classy!
            ~Christian
